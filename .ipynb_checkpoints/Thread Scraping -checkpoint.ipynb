    "Over three different tests for each loop, the results are pretty clear. There is actually an **88.24%** increase in efficiency using multithreading. I will note however that my results have been different depending on the testing method. For example: I got an 82% increase in speed by running the program in Atom. Not a huge difference, but definitely notable. "
